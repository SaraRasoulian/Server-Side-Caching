## Cashing

Caching is a process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage location, known as a cache. The primary objective of caching is to accelerate data delivery to clients, as it eliminates the need to repeatedly fetch the same data from the original source.

Caching is an efficient way to optimize the performance and scalability of your application. By using it, you can reduce resource consumption and latency. Ultimately, it plays a role in improving the user experience of the systems.


## Server-side caching in .NET
There is different ways of implementing server-side caching in a .net project, 3 commonly used techniques include:

### 1. In-Memory caching
In this technique, the application stores temporary data in the main memory, which is RAM. The application holds some portions of the main memory as a cache to store the data. It is lightweight and suitable for scenarios where caching is required within a single instance of an application.

.NET Core has an `IMemoryCache` interface which provides an in-memory caching mechanism for storing and retrieving data.

If the data stored in the cache is smaller, the in-memory cache can be helpful.

### 2. Distributed caching
Distributed caching refers to the practice of sharing a common cache among multiple instances of an application. When a large cache is hosted on a single machine, it can become a performance bottleneck for the application. In contrast, distributing the cached data across multiple locations allows each cache to be more compact and lightweight.

Distributed caching has several advantages over other techniques. One notable benefit is that data remains intact even if a server is restarted. Additionally, distributed caching ensures data consistency across requests made to multiple servers.

In the context of .NET Core, there are various options available for implementing distributed caching. Some commonly used choices include:

- SQL Server Cache
- Redis Cache
- NCache
 
To keep things brief, weâ€™ll only discuss Redis cache in this article.
Regardless of which approach you have implemented, the app interacts with the cache using `IDistributedCache` interface.

If an application needs to scale across multiple instances, the distributed cache is better to choose.

### 3. Response caching
Response caching is specific to web applications and involves caching the entire HTTP responses generated by action methods.

.NET Core provides `[ResponseCache]` attribute and configuration options to enable this.
